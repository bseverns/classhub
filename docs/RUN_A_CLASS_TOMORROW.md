# Run a Class Tomorrow

Use this checklist when you need a first-time teacher flow that works end-to-end without reading the entire manual.

## Action checklist

1. Sign in to `/teach` and verify you can see the correct `Organization` and `Class`.
2. Open the class page and confirm the class details are correct for tomorrow's session.
3. Set the `Enrollment mode` for tomorrow: `Open` if class code access is enough, `Invite only` if students must use an `Invite link`, or `Closed` if enrollment should be blocked.
4. If you are using invite-based enrollment, create or confirm an active `Invite link`.
5. If needed, set an invite expiration time and seat cap.
6. Share the class code or invite link with students through your normal communication channel.
7. Before class starts, open the materials/lesson view you plan to use.
8. As students join, confirm that the roster is filling as expected.
9. During class, direct students to submit their work through the normal class materials flow.
10. If a student cannot join, check whether the invite is expired/full or whether the class is accidentally `Closed`.
11. At the end of the session, review submissions and confirm the roster reflects who participated.
12. Use the teacher action to mark session completion where appropriate.
13. Generate the `Outcomes export` or class summary export for reporting.
14. Open `Certificate eligibility/issuance` and issue certificates for students who meet the threshold.
15. Download the certificate output you need and store it according to your organization's process.
16. If anything looked off, document it the same day and hand it to ops while details are still fresh.

## Before you leave for the day

1. Confirm enrollment is still in the correct state for the next session.
2. Confirm no emergency access change is needed for staff.
3. Save/export what you need now instead of waiting until reporting week.
