## What ClassHub is

ClassHub is the place where you run a class, share materials, control enrollment, review submissions, mark session completion, and export outcomes.

## What ClassHub is not

- It is not asking you to manage student passwords.
- It is not recording every student action for surveillance.
- It is not a substitute for your lesson plan or facilitation judgment.

## 5-minute overview

1. Sign in to `/teach`.
2. Open one of your assigned classes or another class your `Organization` can access.
3. Check `Enrollment mode` before students arrive.
4. If needed, create or confirm an `Invite link` with expiration and seat cap.
5. Run the session, review submissions, mark completion, then use `Outcomes export` or certificate tools.

## What success looks like

- Students can get in without friction.
- You can tell which students joined and submitted work.
- You can close enrollment when needed.
- End-of-session reporting takes minutes, not hours.
- You do not have to explain away hidden data collection.

## Risks avoided

- Avoids storing more student identity data than a cohort session needs.
- Avoids logging helper prompts or private AI exchanges as routine teacher review content.
- Avoids accidental over-sharing when org/class access is configured correctly.
