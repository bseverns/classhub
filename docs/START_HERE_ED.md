## What ClassHub is

ClassHub is a self-hosted learning hub for running classes, enrolling students with low-friction access, capturing learning artifacts, and producing outcomes exports without building a student surveillance system.

## What ClassHub is not

- It is not an ad-tech platform.
- It is not a student behavior surveillance tool.
- It is not a replacement for every SIS, LMS, or donor CRM.
- It does not depend on storing student emails or passwords in the MVP flow.

## 5-minute overview

1. Students join a `Class` with a class code or an `Invite link`, plus a pseudonym display name.
2. Staff sign in through `/teach` and work inside their `Organization` and assigned classes.
3. Teachers can control `Enrollment mode`, seat caps, invite expiration, and certificate issuance.
4. The system supports `Outcomes export` and certificate eligibility/issuance for reporting and follow-up.
5. The Homework Helper stays privacy-forward: no prompt logging, no student profiling, no hidden analytics.

## What success looks like

- Programs can run with low login friction for students.
- Multi-lingual UI support on student-facing content.
- Staff can see who joined, what was submitted, and which students completed sessions.
- Funders and partners can receive bounded exports instead of anecdotal updates.
- The organization owns its own infrastructure, backups, and recovery path.
- Privacy promises are simple enough to explain to families and partners in plain language.

## Risks avoided

- No routine collection of student email/password data for MVP access.
- No AI prompt archive that becomes a new sensitive data store.
- No covert behavior scoring or attendance-surveillance layer.
- No reliance on a vendor dashboard to recover operational records.
