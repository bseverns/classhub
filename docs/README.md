# Documentation Index

## Summary
This page is a compact map. `docs/START_HERE.md` is the canonical landing page.

## What to do now
1. Open `docs/START_HERE.md` first.
2. Use the role table below only if you need a quick link from this page.
3. Keep docs edits plain-language and verification-first.

## Verification signal
A new reader should be able to find their role path without opening more than one extra page.

## Quick picks (by role)

| Role | Start here | Then read |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluator / decision-maker | `docs/PUBLIC_OVERVIEW.md` | `docs/TRY_IT_LOCAL.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md` |
| Teacher / school staff | `docs/NON_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` | `docs/TEACHER_PORTAL.md` |
| Operator / admin | `docs/DAY1_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md` | `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` |
| Developer | `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` |
