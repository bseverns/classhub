# Program Lifecycle

This page explains how ClassHub supports a program from first outreach through renewal reporting. It is written for fundraising, partnerships, and operations staff who need a realistic picture of what the platform produces.

## Revenue lens

If your organization runs earned-income programs, the relevant value is operational leverage:

- `Invite link` controls make paid or limited-seat cohorts easier to manage.
- `Outcomes export` reduces the work needed for sponsor, payer, or parent-facing reporting.
- `Certificate eligibility/issuance` gives programs a concrete completion artifact.
- org and role controls reduce the need for shared accounts when multiple staff or partner teams are involved.

ClassHub does not include billing. It does reduce the amount of manual coordination around enrollment, delivery evidence, and repeat-program setup.
