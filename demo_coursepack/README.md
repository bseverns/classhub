# Demo Coursepack

## Summary
This folder contains a minimal, safe demo coursepack for public evaluation and local trials.

## What to do now
1. Load it with `bash scripts/load_demo_coursepack.sh`.
2. Join the generated class code as a student.
3. Open `/teach` and review the two demo lesson sessions.

## Verification signal
After import, `/teach` shows one demo class with 2 sessions and a built-in upload dropbox from lesson metadata.

## What this demonstrates
- 1 course with 2 lessons
- lesson video metadata (placeholder URL)
- upload assignment generation (`submission.type: file`)
- rubric/checklist in lesson content
- helper prompt example with bounded, anti-cheating framing

## Safety notes
- Contains no real student or school data.
- Intended for local demo/evaluation and resettable environments.
- See reset instructions in `docs/TRY_IT_LOCAL.md`.
