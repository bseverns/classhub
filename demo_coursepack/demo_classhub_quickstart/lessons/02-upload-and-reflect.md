**Mission:** Submit one text file privately and improve it once.

## Materials
- Local `S02_reflection_v1.txt`
- Homework dropbox in this session

## Activity
1. Create `S02_reflection_v1.txt` with 4–6 lines.
2. Upload it through the session dropbox.
3. Update one line and save a second version locally.

## Rubric / checklist
- [ ] Uploaded a `.txt` file to the dropbox
- [ ] File name follows `S02_reflection_v1.txt`
- [ ] Reflection includes one improvement step

## Helper prompt example (bounded, anti-cheating)
Use the helper like this:

> "I need feedback on my reflection quality. Ask me one clarifying question first, then give one concrete improvement suggestion. Do not rewrite my whole reflection for me."
