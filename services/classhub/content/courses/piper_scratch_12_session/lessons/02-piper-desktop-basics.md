**Mission:** Animate a character and understand frame-by-frame timing.

## Teacher prep (before class)
- Print **Handout 02** (Animation Recipe).
- Prepare one “too fast” example to fix with the class.

## Materials
- Devices with Scratch
- Timer visible
- Handouts (if used)

## Agenda (60 minutes)
**0:00–0:05 Launch**
- “Hands off keys.”
- Say today’s mission.
- Quick preview: what should be working by minute 40.

**0:05–0:12 Micro-lesson (demo)**
- Open a sprite costume tab: duplicate, edit, flip.
- Build live: walk cycle using `next costume` inside a loop.
- Teach: `repeat`, `wait`, `next costume`.

**0:12–0:42 Build sprints**
**Sprint A:** Create 2–4 costumes and make a short animation (idle or walk).  
**Reset:** Save + show teacher animation once.  
**Sprint B:** Add a second animation (jump, wave, blink).  
**Reset:** Stretch + save.  
**Sprint C:** Add a short “intro animation” on green flag (character enters stage).

**0:42–0:52 Playtest rotation**
- Prompt: “Which animation feels smooth? Which feels too fast?”
- Testers suggest one timing change: slower or faster.

**0:52–1:00 Share + Save**
- 2–3 shares.
- Everyone writes: “Next time I will…”

## Checkpoints (what you must see working)
- Sprite has 2+ costumes.
- A script switches costumes with timing (not instant chaos).

## Common stuck points + fixes
- If it doesn’t start: add a hat block (green flag / key press).
- If it loops forever: add a condition or a reset.

## Extensions (fast finisher menu)
- Add an animated enemy or pet.
- Add sound synced to animation.
- Create a looping background animation (clouds drifting).
