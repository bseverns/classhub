**Mission:** Create Cutscene 1 and use broadcast messages to control it.

## Teacher prep (before class)
- Print **Handout 07** (Cutscene Storyboard).
- Decide a default broadcast name set (freeze/unfreeze).

## Materials
- Devices with Scratch
- Timer visible
- Handouts (if used)

## Agenda (60 minutes)
**0:00–0:05 Launch**
- “Hands off keys.”
- Say today’s mission.
- Quick preview: what should be working by minute 40.

**0:05–0:12 Micro-lesson (demo)**
- Teach 3 rules of cutscenes:
  1) freeze controls
  2) show story beats (say/think + movement)
  3) unfreeze and start next level
- Teach: `broadcast and wait`, `show/hide`, timing with `wait`.

**0:12–0:42 Build sprints**
**Sprint A:** Create a Cutscene1 backdrop and a cutscene script that runs when Level1 is complete.  
**Reset:** Save + teacher checks “controls freeze.”  
**Sprint B:** Add 2–4 story beats (dialogue + movement/animation).  
**Reset:** Stand + save.  
**Sprint C:** End the cutscene by switching to Level2 and unfreezing controls.

**0:42–0:52 Playtest rotation**
- Prompt: “Does the cutscene clearly tell you what changes in Level 2?”
- Testers must answer: “What is my new mission?”

**0:52–1:00 Share + Save**
- 2–3 shares.
- Everyone writes: “Next time I will…”

## Checkpoints (what you must see working)
- Cutscene triggers after Level 1 win.
- Player cannot move during cutscene.
- Cutscene ends and Level 2 begins.

## Common stuck points + fixes
- If it doesn’t start: add a hat block (green flag / key press).
- If it loops forever: add a condition or a reset.

## Extensions (fast finisher menu)
- Add camera tricks: fade (change brightness effect), zoom illusion (sprite size), dramatic pause.
- Add a second character entering/exiting.
- Add a short sound cue between beats.
