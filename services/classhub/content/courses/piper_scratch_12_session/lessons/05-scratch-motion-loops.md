**Mission:** Design Level 1 with a clear goal and a plan for Level 2.

## Teacher prep (before class)
- Print **Handout 05** (Level Map Worksheet).
- Bring pencils/markers for quick planning.

## Materials
- Devices with Scratch
- Timer visible
- Handouts (if used)

## Agenda (60 minutes)
**0:00–0:05 Launch**
- “Hands off keys.”
- Say today’s mission.
- Quick preview: what should be working by minute 40.

**0:05–0:12 Micro-lesson (demo)**
- Show 3 win conditions:
  1) reach the door,
  2) collect X points,
  3) survive Y seconds.
- Teach: `wait until`, comparisons (`>`, `=`), simple timers.

**0:12–0:42 Build sprints**
**Sprint A:** Choose a win condition and make it work in Level 1.  
**Reset:** Save + fill out Level Map worksheet.  
**Sprint B:** Add obstacles that match the goal (not random chaos).  
**Reset:** Stand + save.  
**Sprint C:** Build a “door” sprite that you’ll use for level transitions next week.

**0:42–0:52 Playtest rotation**
- Prompt: “Do you know what to do in the first 10 seconds?”
- Testers must say the goal out loud.

**0:52–1:00 Share + Save**
- 2–3 shares.
- Everyone writes: “Next time I will…”

## Checkpoints (what you must see working)
- Level 1 has a goal that can be completed.
- A win moment triggers something visible (message, sound, or screen).

## Common stuck points + fixes
- If it doesn’t start: add a hat block (green flag / key press).
- If it loops forever: add a condition or a reset.

## Extensions (fast finisher menu)
- Add a checkpoint halfway through Level 1.
- Add a tutorial hint (text bubble) triggered after 5 seconds.
- Add a bonus collectible that’s risky to reach.
