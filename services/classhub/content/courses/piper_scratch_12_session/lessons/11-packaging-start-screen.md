**Mission:** Fix the top bugs and confusion points using playtest data.

## Teacher prep (before class)
- Print **Handout 11** (Playtest + Bug Cards).
- Set the tone: debugging is normal, not failure.

## Materials
- Devices with Scratch
- Timer visible
- Handouts (if used)

## Agenda (60 minutes)
**0:00–0:05 Launch**
- “Hands off keys.”
- Say today’s mission.
- Quick preview: what should be working by minute 40.

**0:05–0:12 Micro-lesson (demo)**
- Teach the debugging script:
  1) Recreate the bug.
  2) Point to the script that caused it.
  3) Say what you expected.
  4) Change one thing and test again.
- Model fixing a common bug (score climbing forever).

**0:12–0:42 Build sprints**
**Sprint A:** Full-class playtest rotation (2 minutes each project).  
**Reset:** Save + choose top 3 issues.  
**Sprint B:** Fix Issue #1 completely.  
**Reset:** Stand + save.  
**Sprint C:** Fix Issue #2 or #3, then retest with a partner.

**0:42–0:52 Playtest rotation**
- Prompt: “Write down one bug and one confusion.”
- Use bug cards + playtest sheet.

**0:52–1:00 Share + Save**
- 2–3 shares.
- Everyone writes: “Next time I will…”

## Checkpoints (what you must see working)
- Student can describe at least one bug clearly.
- At least one meaningful fix is implemented and tested.

## Common stuck points + fixes
- If it doesn’t start: add a hat block (green flag / key press).
- If it loops forever: add a condition or a reset.

## Extensions (fast finisher menu)
- Add a final cutscene or cinematic win moment.
- Improve balancing (speed, spawn rate, timer).
- Add accessibility: slower mode or hints.
