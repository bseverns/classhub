- Timer visible
- Handouts (if used)

## Agenda (60 minutes)
**0:00–0:05 Launch**
- “Hands off keys.”
- Say today’s mission.
- Quick preview: what should be working by minute 40.

**0:05–0:12 Micro-lesson (demo)**
- Model a 30-second creator talk:
  - controls + goal
  - favorite moment
  - hardest part + how you solved it
- Teach: how to share project link and credit assets (if used).

**0:12–0:42 Build sprints**
**Sprint A:** Final fixes + final save + project title cleanup.  
**Reset:** Save + test start-to-finish once.  
**Sprint B:** Create a short “instructions card” on the menu or first scene.  
**Reset:** Stand + save.  
**Sprint C:** Showcase setup: stations, rotation order, creator talk practice.

**0:42–0:52 Playtest rotation**
- Prompt: “Play like a guest at a museum. Leave a kind note.”
- Optional: sticky-note feedback.

**0:52–1:00 Share + Save**
- 2–3 shares.
- Everyone writes: “Next time I will…”

## Checkpoints (what you must see working)
