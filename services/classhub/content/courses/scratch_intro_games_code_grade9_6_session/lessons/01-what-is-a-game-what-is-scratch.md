    - "Student can identify one event block and one condition block."
    - "Student can explain one intentional change."

**Theme:** Orientation and curiosity

## Objectives
- Define game as goal + rules + feedback.
- Learn Scratch layout (Sprite, Stage, Script, Costumes, Sounds).
- Make one visible change to a starter game.

## Artifacts
- Remixed Scratch game.
- Two-sentence reflection:
  - "I changed ___."
  - "It made the game ___."

## Entry routine (first 3 minutes)
- Open browser and Scratch starter link.
- Rename remix using your class naming pattern.
- Confirm partner/help protocol for stuck moments.

## Plan (60 minutes)
0-5 min: Launch and today's goal.  
5-12 min: Mini-lesson: goal/rules/feedback plus Scratch tour.  
12-35 min: Guided remix sprint.
- Minimal path:
  - change costume or background
  - change one gameplay number (speed, jump, score)
- Extension path:
  - add a second obstacle or power-up  
35-48 min: Code reading circle.
- Point to the event block that starts movement.
- Find one `if` and explain it in plain language.  
48-55 min: Save and submit routine.  
55-60 min: Exit ticket (name one term: sprite, stage, event, condition).

## Help protocol
- 1 minute: try one small test change.
- 2 minutes: ask a neighbor to interpret the script.
- 3 minutes: teacher check-in.

## Common failure modes
- Scratch will not load:
  - use screenshot worksheet flow and live demo notes.
- Students cannot share links:
  - submit screenshot of code + stage + reflection instead.

## Vocabulary focus
- Sprite
- Stage
- Script
- Event
- Condition
- Feedback
