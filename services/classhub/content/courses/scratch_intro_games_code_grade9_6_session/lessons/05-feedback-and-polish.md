**Theme:** Games communicate through feeling

## Objectives
- Add feedback to at least three events:
  - start
  - score
  - fail or win
- Improve readability through instructions, UI, and pacing.

## Plan (60 minutes)
0-5 min: Entry routine.  
5-12 min: Mini-lesson: feedback teaches players the rules.  
12-40 min: Remix sprint.
- Minimal path:
  - add sound on score
  - add visual change on hit
  - add start instructions or short start screen
- Extension path:
  - add effect sequence or pseudo-particle burst
  - add difficulty ramp over time  
40-50 min: Structured peer playtest.
- 2 minutes play
- 1 minute feedback:
  - "What was unclear?"
  - "What felt good?"  
50-55 min: Save/submit + reflection.  
55-60 min: Exit ticket: one feedback change and why.

## Reflection prompts
- "I added feedback for ___ event by ___."
- "This helps players because ___."

## Vocabulary focus
- Feedback
- Clarity
- Pacing
- Player experience
