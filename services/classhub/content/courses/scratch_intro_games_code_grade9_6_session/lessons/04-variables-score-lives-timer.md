**Theme:** Named numbers that make games feel real

## Objectives
- Create or modify a variable.
- Use `set`, `change`, and show/hide display intentionally.
- Connect variable updates to gameplay events.

## Plan (60 minutes)
0-5 min: Entry routine.  
5-15 min: Mini-lesson: variable as memory number.  
15-40 min: Remix sprint.
- Minimal path:
  - change scoring amount (for example +1 to +5), or
  - add lives that decrease on hit
- Extension path:
  - add combo multiplier
  - add countdown timer  
40-50 min: UI clarity pass.
- Show variable on stage.
- Ensure variable resets at game start.  
50-55 min: Save/submit + reflection.  
55-60 min: Exit ticket: explain what your variable represents.

## Reflection prompts
- "My variable tracks ___."
- "I update it when ___ happens."

## Vocabulary focus
- Variable
- State
- Set
- Change
