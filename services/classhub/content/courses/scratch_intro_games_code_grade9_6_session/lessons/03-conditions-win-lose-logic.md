help:
  quick_fixes:
    - "Treat each `if` as a question; read it out loud."
    - "Test one rule at a time before layering additional checks."
    - "If logic is confusing, write rule in English first, then map to blocks."
extend:
  - "Add multiple win conditions."
  - "Add restart behavior after lose state."

  purpose: "Translate plain-language rules into reliable condition blocks."
  snags:
    - "Nested conditions become hard to reason about."
    - "No feedback makes win/lose unclear to players."
  assessment:
    - "Student can state one if/then rule in English and point to code."
    - "Student can explain why changed rule affects difficulty."

**Theme:** Rules become code

## Objectives
- Understand `if` as a rule gate.
- Modify win/lose conditions.
- Add clear feedback for game states.

## Plan (60 minutes)
0-5 min: Entry routine.  
5-15 min: Mini-lesson on condition blocks.
- Example rules:
  - `if touching obstacle`
  - `if score > 10`  
15-40 min: Remix sprint.
- Minimal path:
  - change win threshold
  - change lose condition
- Extension path:
  - add multiple win conditions
  - add restart button or reset flow  
40-50 min: Feedback pass.
- Add sound/message/animation for win and lose.  
50-55 min: Save/submit + reflection.  
55-60 min: Exit ticket: write one game rule and point to matching block.

## Reflection prompts
- "My rule says: if ___, then ___."
- "I changed it because I wanted the game to feel ___."

## Vocabulary focus
- Condition
- Rule
- Event
- Feedback
