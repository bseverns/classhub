## At a glance
- **Big question:** What breaks when you run it for real time with real bodies?
- **Outputs:** drift plan dossier v2
- **In-class mode:** rehearsal → observation → iteration

## Learning goals
Students will:
- rehearse the drift in a controlled setting
- practice roles and handoffs
- iterate based on observed failure points

## Before class (instructor)
- Reserve space for rehearsal.
- Remind teams to bring signage drafts and scripts.

## Materials
- everything needed to simulate the drift (even if rough)
- camera/phone for internal documentation (consent-forward)

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Setup (10)**

2) **Rehearsal run #1 (25)**  
   Run for 10–15 minutes, then stop.

3) **Debrief (15)**  
   What confused people? Where did energy die? Where did it spike?

4) **Iteration sprint (25)**  
   Rewrite instructions, tighten cues, simplify rules.

5) **Rehearsal run #2 (25)**  
   Run again with changes.

6) **Telemetry check (20)**  
   Are you capturing too much? Too little? What’s meaningful?

7) **Packaging sprint (25)**  
   Update dossier: scripts, roles, signage, stop conditions.

8) **Close (5)**

## After class / homework
- Submit **Drift Plan Dossier v2** (near-final).
- **Micro #8:** accessibility pass (1 page).
