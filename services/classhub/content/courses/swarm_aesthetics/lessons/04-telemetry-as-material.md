## At a glance
- **Big question:** What can you learn without turning people into data?
- **Outputs:** trace study + telemetry plan draft
- **In-class mode:** examples → capture methods → translation lab

## Learning goals
Students will:
- distinguish observation from surveillance
- collect non-identifying traces (counts, timings, paths, fragments)
- translate traces into form (score, map, sound, animation)

## Before class (instructor)
- Prepare 3 examples of creative telemetry (maps, sonification, logs-as-poem).
- Bring a simple “counting” dataset example (e.g., door clicks per minute).

## Materials
- notebooks, graph paper
- optional: phones for audio recording (with consent) / simple step counters
- sticky tape for temporary floor mapping

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Primer: telemetry is a choice (15)**  
   What you measure is what you make important.

2) **Capture methods menu (15)**  
   Counts, paths, intervals, clusters, heat, rhythm, drift notes.

3) **Field capture (25)**  
   In/near classroom: capture one non-identifying trace for 10 minutes.

4) **Translation lab (55)**  
   Turn your trace into one of:  
   - a map + legend  
   - a 1-minute score  
   - a visual loop (hand-drawn or coded)  
   - a sound sketch (optional)

5) **Share + critique (30)**  
   Ask: what does this trace *exclude*?

6) **Close (10)**  
   Next week: assumptions + ethics.

## After class / homework
- **Micro #4:** finalize the trace study (1–2 pages).
- Teams add a **Telemetry Plan** section to Recipe v1.
