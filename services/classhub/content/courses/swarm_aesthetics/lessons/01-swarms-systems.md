title: "Swarms & Systems"
duration_minutes: 75
needs:
  - "paper, pens, sticky notes, tape"
  - "projector (optional)"
  - "tokens (30–100)"
  - "laptops only if you want a quick boids demo"

## At a glance
- **Big question:** How do many small actions become a pattern you can feel?
- **Outputs:** field notebook setup + one “swarm system” diagram draft
- **In-class mode:** seminar warm-up → exercises → diagram lab

## Learning goals
Students will:
- build a shared vocabulary (agents, rules, constraints, feedback, emergence)
- practice reading a system as a diagram (not as a story)
- begin a field notebook as an ongoing telemetry tool

## Before class (instructor)
- Bring 3 swarm examples (video or story): biological, computational, social.
- Print or share a one-page systems primer (stocks/flows + feedback loops).
- Prepare a table of “tokens” (sticky notes, coins, small objects) for a tabletop swarm.

## Materials
- paper, pens, sticky notes, tape
- projector (optional)
- tokens (30–100)
- laptops only if you want a quick boids demo

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Opening pulse (10)**  
   “Name one swarm you’ve been inside this week.”

2) **Mini-lecture: swarms as constraints (15)**  
   Not the romance—just the mechanics: local rules, global patterns.

3) **Exercise: tabletop swarm (25)**  
   Small groups invent 3 rules using tokens. Run for 2 minutes. Change one rule. Run again.

4) **Debrief: what changed? what didn’t? (10)**  
   Identify feedback loops and bottlenecks.

5) **Diagram lab: map a swarm system (35)**  
   Each student chooses a real system (cafeteria line, hallway, group chat).  
   Draw boundaries, actors, signals, and feedback loops. Add 5 assumptions.

6) **Gallery walk + “I notice / I wonder” (20)**

7) **Field notebook setup (10)**  
   Decide your format. Commit to one page/week minimum.

8) **Close: next week preview (5)**  
   Drift method begins.

## After class / homework
- **Micro #1:** “Swarm you’ve lived inside” diagram (1 page) + 200–400 words.
- Skim the *Perceptual Drift* anchor doc (or assigned excerpt).
