## At a glance
- **Big question:** What do we refuse to do, even if it would be “effective”?
- **Outputs:** ethics charter + risk checklist + assumption audit
- **In-class mode:** case study → refusal workshop → redesign

## Learning goals
Students will:
- identify ethical failure modes in participatory/system work
- write a practical ethics charter for their drift
- redesign their plan to increase consent and legibility

## Before class (instructor)
- Bring 1–2 case studies where “cool systems” caused harm (privacy, exclusion, coercion).
- Print `templates/ETHICS_CHARTER.md` and `templates/RISK_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Materials
- printed templates
- whiteboard for “assumptions wall”

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Case study discussion (25)**  
   Map: intent → implementation → harm.

2) **Assumptions wall (20)**  
   Each team lists 20 assumptions; label: harmless / risky / unacceptable.

3) **Ethics charter workshop (35)**  
   Teams complete the charter and choose their “hard no’s.”

4) **Risk checklist + mitigations (25)**  
   Name stop conditions. Assign authority to stop.

5) **Redesign sprint (35)**  
   Modify Recipe v1 and Role Deck v1 to embed care: signage, opt-out, data-minimalism.

6) **Close (10)**  
   Next week: prototype 0.

## After class / homework
- Submit **Ethics Charter + Risk Checklist**.
- **Micro #5:** assumption audit (individual; 1 page).
