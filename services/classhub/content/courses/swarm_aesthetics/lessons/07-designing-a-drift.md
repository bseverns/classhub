needs:
  - "paper, tape, markers"
  - "optional: simple signage materials (cardstock)"

## At a glance
- **Big question:** How do you turn swarm logic into an event people can actually join?
- **Outputs:** drift plan dossier v1
- **In-class mode:** site thinking → script writing → failure rehearsal

## Learning goals
Students will:
- choose a site/context and design for its constraints
- write a clear event script with join/leave mechanics
- anticipate breakdowns and design graceful exits

## Before class (instructor)
- Confirm where the Week 10 showing will happen.
- Bring basic floorplans or allow students to map the space.

## Materials
- paper, tape, markers
- optional: simple signage materials (cardstock)

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Site mapping (25)**  
   Teams sketch the space: flows, bottlenecks, edges, “quiet zones.”

2) **Audience definition (15)**  
   Who is this for? Who might be excluded? What does “opt-in” mean here?

3) **Script sprint (35)**  
   Write: welcome, consent, start cue, ongoing loop, stop cue, debrief prompt.

4) **Failure rehearsal (30)**  
   “What if nobody joins?” “What if too many join?” “What if someone is upset?”  
   Add stop conditions and fixes.

5) **Dossier assembly (35)**  
   Compile: intent, system map v1, recipe v2, roles v2, ethics, risk, script, materials list.

6) **Close (10)**  
   Next week: rehearsal lab.

## After class / homework
- Submit **Drift Plan Dossier v1**.
- **Micro #7:** failure map (1 page).
