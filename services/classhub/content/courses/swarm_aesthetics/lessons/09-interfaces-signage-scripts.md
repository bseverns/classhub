## At a glance
- **Big question:** Can a stranger understand this in 15 seconds?
- **Outputs:** final signage kit + cue sheet + facilitation script
- **In-class mode:** design studio + usability tests

## Learning goals
Students will:
- design legible instructions and wayfinding
- test signage for comprehension and comfort
- finalize scripts that protect consent and clarity

## Before class (instructor)
- Bring examples of good/bad signage.
- Provide printing access if possible (or plan for hand-made signage).

## Materials
- cardstock, markers, tape
- optional: printer
- timer for “15-second read” tests

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Signage principles (10)**  
   Short, kind, specific. Always include exit.

2) **Design sprint (45)**  
   Build: main sign + join/leave instructions + role lanyards/badges (optional).

3) **15-second tests (35)**  
   Swap with another team. Observe: what they misunderstand.

4) **Script + cue sheet finalization (35)**  
   Tighten welcome/consent language. Add stop phrases and emergency fallback.

5) **Run-through (20)**  
   Dry run with signage and scripts in place.

6) **Close (5)**  
   Next week: showing.

## After class / homework
- Submit **Interface/Signage Kit + Script/Cue Sheet**.
- **Micro #9:** one-page “participant guide” (PDF).
