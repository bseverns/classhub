course: swarm_aesthetics
session: 3
slug: s03-recipes-roles
title: "Recipes & Roles"
duration_minutes: 75
needs:
  - "paper, markers, index cards"
  - "optional: shared doc space for teams"
---
## At a glance
- **Big question:** Can you write a swarm so clearly someone else can run it?
- **Outputs:** team formation + recipe v1 + role cards v1
- **In-class mode:** patterns → procedural writing → role deck sprint

## Learning goals
Students will:
- understand recipes as interfaces (not just descriptions)
- design roles that make care and legibility real
- form drift teams and pick a draft direction

## Before class (instructor)
- Bring 2–3 examples of procedural formats: scores, checklists, facilitation scripts.
- Print `templates/RECIPE_TEMPLATE.md` and `templates/ROLE_CARD_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Materials
- paper, markers, index cards
- optional: shared doc space for teams

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Warm-up: micro-score (10)**  
   Everyone writes a 6-step score for “making a room feel different.”

2) **Talk: recipe vs narrative (15)**  
   A recipe has conditions, thresholds, and fail-safes.

3) **Team formation (20)**  
   Skill/appetite survey → groups of 3–5.

4) **Recipe sprint v1 (35)**  
   Teams draft: intent, materials, 6–10 steps, 3–8 rules, telemetry plan.

5) **Role deck sprint v1 (35)**  
   Each team makes 6–10 role cards. Required roles:  
   - Safety/consent  
   - Facilitator/host  
   - Mapper/telemetry  
   - Archivist/documentation

6) **Read-out + critique (25)**  
   Focus: legibility, ethics, and “what could go wrong?”

7) **Close (10)**  
   Next week: telemetry as material.

## After class / homework
- Submit **Recipe v1 + Role Cards v1**.
- **Micro #3:** revise one role card after observing your own daily swarms.
