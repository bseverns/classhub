## At a glance
- **Big question:** What does your swarm become when it meets a room?
- **Outputs:** event run + immediate postmortem notes + documentation capture
- **In-class mode:** run the work → breathe → log

## Learning goals
Students will:
- host a drift with clarity and care
- practice roles in real time
- capture documentation without violating consent

## Before class (instructor)
- Confirm schedule and transitions between teams.
- Confirm documentation norms and consent language.
- Prepare a simple “viewer feedback card” (optional).

## Materials
- signage
- scripts/cue sheets
- minimal documentation tools (photos of space, not faces, unless consented)

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Setup window (20)**  
   Teams set signage, test cues, assign roles.

2) **Showings (90)**  
   Example: 3 teams × 25 minutes each + 5 minute transitions.  
   (Adjust to class size.)

3) **Immediate postmortem (20)**  
   Each team writes: what held / what broke / one surprise / one next move.

4) **Close (20)**  
   Collect traces and documentation assets in a shared folder.

## After class / homework
- Submit **Postmortem Notes** (same day if possible).
- Start assembling the documentation bundle.
