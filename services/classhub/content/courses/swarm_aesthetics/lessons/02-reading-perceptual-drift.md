## At a glance
- **Big question:** What changes when attention becomes a tool you hold deliberately?
- **Outputs:** drift notes + diagram redraw
- **In-class mode:** guided drift → reading studio → redraw lab

## Learning goals
Students will:
- practice a short, safe drift as shared method
- translate observation into non-identifying telemetry
- redraw a system diagram with “perceptual drift” as a lens

## Before class (instructor)
- Choose a drift route (10–15 min) that is safe, accessible, and weather-proof if needed.
- Prepare a one-page “drift protocol” (opt-out, regroup points, no covert recording).
- Assign *Perceptual Drift* and 1 short contextual excerpt (psychogeography / field method).

## Materials
- notebooks
- timer
- optional: printed route map

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Set the guardrails (10)**  
   Consent, opt-out, regroup point, no identifying capture.

2) **Guided micro-drift (30)**  
   Prompts every 5 minutes:  
   - “Follow sound.”  
   - “Follow edges.”  
   - “Follow repeated colors.”  
   - “Follow gaps.”  
   Capture notes as counts, fragments, sketches—no names/faces.

3) **Return + decompress (10)**  
   2 minutes silent writing, then pair share.

4) **Reading studio (35)**  
   Small groups: extract 5 “moves” from *Perceptual Drift* as instructions.

5) **Diagram redraw (45)**  
   Choose one diagram from last week. Redraw it using drift language:  
   signals become “cues,” feedback becomes “pull,” constraints become “walls.”

6) **Close (10)**  
   Introduce the idea of recipes + roles.

## After class / homework
- **Micro #2:** drift notes (1 page) + diagram redraw (1 page).
- Bring one example of instruction-based art / score / protocol that you admire.
