title: "Prototype 0: Screen / Tabletop Swarm"
duration_minutes: 75
needs:
  - "laptops (if digital) / tokens (if tabletop)"
  - "timers, notebooks"

## At a glance
- **Big question:** What is the smallest swarm you can build that still teaches you something?
- **Outputs:** prototype 0 + parameter sheet + midcourse reflection
- **In-class mode:** build → probe → log → share

## Learning goals
Students will:
- prototype a minimal swarm behavior (digital or physical)
- run parameter probes and record outcomes
- connect rules to experience: what it feels like when the system shifts

## Before class (instructor)
- Decide tech tier and prep starter materials:
  - Simulation-only: p5.js boids starter / NetLogo model
  - Tabletop: tokens + rule cards + timer
- Prepare `templates/DOCUMENTATION_BUNDLE_CHECKLIST.md` as preview of where this is going.

## Materials
- laptops (if digital) / tokens (if tabletop)
- timers, notebooks

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Prototype constraints (10)**  
   “It must run in 60 seconds. It must be explainable in 30 seconds.”

2) **Build sprint (55)**  
   Teams build Prototype 0: 3–8 rules, visible behavior, simple reset.

3) **Parameter probe (35)**  
   Change one parameter 10 times. Log: what changed, what didn’t, what surprised you.

4) **Show-and-tell (35)**  
   Each team demos + shares one insight.

5) **Midcourse reflection (15)**  
   Individual writing: what do you think your drift wants to be?

## After class / homework
- Submit **Prototype 0 + Parameter Sheet** (screenshots/video acceptable).
- **Micro #6:** parameter probe write-up (1 page) OR midcourse reflection (600–900 words).
