## At a glance
- **Big question:** What do you want this drift to become—and what should it never become?
- **Outputs:** final documentation bundle + final critique
- **In-class mode:** presentations → critique → futures

## Learning goals
Students will:
- present a portable drift with evidence and clarity
- critique systems work with attention to ethics, legibility, and craft
- articulate future iterations and boundaries

## Before class (instructor)
- Decide the critique format (round-robin or gallery stations).
- Set the “futures constraint”: one smaller version, one bigger version, both ethical.

## Materials
- printed bundles or laptops
- optional: small exhibit setup (tables, clips, tape)

## In-class plan (150 min)
1) **Setup (10)**

2) **Final presentations (90)**  
   8–10 minutes/team presentation + 5 minutes critique.  
   Focus: system map → drift → what the traces taught you.

3) **Futures round (25)**  
   Each team shares:
   - one smaller, more intimate version
   - one larger version (with additional safeguards)
   - one “hard no” future path

4) **Closing ritual (15)**  
   Students write a 6-sentence reflection: what you learned about systems, and about care.

## After class
- Submit **Final Documentation Bundle** (if not already turned in).
- Optional: publish class archive (zine/site/repo) within two weeks.
