                <p>We design this platform to collect as little about you as possible.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Accounts:</strong> You don't create an account or provide an email. You log in using
                        an anonymous class code and a display name you choose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Uploads:</strong> Files, reflections, and checklist items you submit for class
                        activities are saved so your teacher can review them.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Logs:</strong> We keep minimal system logs (like basic diagnostic events when
                        joining/uploading). These are metadata only and do not contain student identifying details.</li>

                    records, social security cards, passwords, or financial information). We do not require this
                    information for any workshop.

                <p>You own your artifacts. While you are in an active session, you can export or delete your files at
                    any time.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>From the classroom dashboard, click the <strong>"My Data"</strong> link or navigate to

                <p>We don't hold on to your data forever.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automated Cleanup:</strong> If enabled by the operator, student submissions and system
                        events are automatically deleted after a specified retention period (often 90 to 180 days after
                        a workshop ends).</li>
                    <li><strong>Teacher Actions:</strong> Teachers can manually clear rosters and delete student data at
                        the end of a session.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Actions:</strong> As described above, you can delete your own work at any time via
                        the "My Data" portal.</li>
