# Piper Scratch Helper Reference

- Piper Computer is a Raspberry Pi-based learning computer kit.
- Students use the Piper desktop (PiperOS) and Scratch (web or app).
- Typical workflow: open Scratch, make changes, download `.sb3`, upload to the LMS.
- Files usually live in Downloads; rename or move them into a project folder.
- Emphasize private-first: save locally, then upload privately (no public sharing).
- Most tasks are inside Scratch + the file system (Downloads, folders, renaming).
