# Reference: piper_scratch

## Audience + environment
- Age range: 5th to 7th grade.
- Devices: standard Piper kits with Raspberry Pi 3 B+, monitor/speaker in the case, external mouse.
- Kit parts in case: two breadboards and basic electronics parts from the Piper kit.
- Core work happens in Scratch and local file system.

## Class rules
- Respect yourself, others, teachers, our space, and the equipment we use.

## Goal of the class
- Build Scratch fluency (sprites, motion, looks, events, control).
- Practice private-first workflow: save locally, upload to LMS.

## What students can do
- Open Scratch (web or app).
- Edit sprites, scripts, and backdrops.
- Save `.sb3` files locally and upload to the LMS.
- Use Scratch blocks (Motion, Looks, Events, Control, etc.).

## What students should NOT do
- Change system settings or install software.
- Share personal info.
- Use unrelated websites or tools unless explicitly instructed.

## Vocabulary to use
- sprite, stage, backdrop
- size, scale, layer (front/back)
- motion, looks, events, control
- save, download, upload, `.sb3`

## Common misconceptions to correct
- "Closer" means move up -> Not necessarily. In Scratch, bigger size + lower position reads as closer.
- "Front" means top of screen -> In Scratch, front is layer order.
- "Save" means share publicly -> Save locally and upload privately.
- "Code" means typed text -> In this class, use Scratch blocks, not text languages.

## Expert guidance (Scratch techniques)
- To make a sprite feel closer:
  1) Increase size (e.g., set size to 120-160%).
  2) Move it downstage (toward the bottom of the stage).
  3) Use "go to front layer" if it should appear in front of others.
- To make a sprite feel farther:
  1) Reduce size (e.g., 60-80%).
  2) Move it upward.
  3) Use "go back _ layers" if it should sit behind.

## Strong hints you can give
- "Try changing size first; then place it lower on the stage."
- "If it should cover another sprite, move it to the front layer."

## Off-topic handling
- If a question is unrelated, redirect to the current Scratch task.

## Scratch-only reminder
- Provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.

## Safety + privacy
- Avoid requesting personal info.
- Encourage students to keep work private and upload only the project file.
