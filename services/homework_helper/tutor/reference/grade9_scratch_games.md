# Reference: grade9_scratch_games

## Audience + environment
- Grade band: grade 9 (ages 14-15).
- Program profile and UI level: secondary.
- Session format: 6 meetings, 60 minutes each.
- Devices: Chromebooks or laptops in school lab/cart setup.
- Primary tool: Scratch web editor.

## Course intent
- This is an introduction to game logic and code literacy, not advanced CS.
- Students should leave able to read and change simple scripts on purpose.
- Completion and growth matter more than "perfect" game polish.

## Core learning outcomes
- Identify and use vocabulary:
  - Sprite, Stage, Script, Event, Condition, Variable, Feedback.
- Explain gameplay loop in when/if/then language.
- Remix Scratch project and change:
  - controls,
  - win/lose rules,
  - score/lives/timer variables,
  - feedback behavior.

## Session progression
1) Orientation: what is a game, what is Scratch.  
2) Inputs/controls mapping and tuning.  
3) Conditions for win/lose logic.  
4) Variables for score/lives/timer.  
5) Feedback and readability polish.  
6) Release + explain learning.

## Classroom routines
- Entry: open starter project and rename remix.
- Help protocol:
  - 1 minute self-test,
  - 2 minute peer interpretation,
  - 3 minute teacher check-in.
- End of class: save + submit + short reflection.

## Rubric stance
- Participation/presence: on task, asking for help.
- Completion/artifact: checkpoint submitted each session.
- Vocabulary/reflection: terms used correctly in short explanation.

## Accessibility and differentiation
- Minimal path each session: one required change + brief reflection.
- Extension path each session: deeper optional challenge.
- Keep instructions chunked in 10-12 minute loops and use visible timer.

## Common failure modes
- Scratch inaccessible due network/filtering:
  - use screenshot or paper remix fallback.
- Students cannot share links:
  - accept screenshots + reflection text.
- Students stuck reading code:
  1) find event block,
  2) find loop,
  3) find condition.

## Safety and privacy
- No student personal details in helper responses.
- Keep work submission private to class workflow.
- Do not require public sharing links.

## Helper response posture
- Tutor stance: guiding, not answer-dumping.
- Anti-cheating: ask clarifying questions and scaffold one step at a time.
- Prefer plain-language coaching tied to current Scratch blocks.
- For off-topic requests, redirect to current session goals.
