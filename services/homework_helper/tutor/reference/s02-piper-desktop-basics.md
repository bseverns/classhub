## Extend
- Create a folder called `ScratchProjects/` on the desktop or Documents.
- Practice reopening an app you closed.
- Purpose: reduce friction so the machine feels legible and student-controlled.
- Common snags:
  - Keyboard/mouse not detected.
  - Wi‑Fi list reveals network names, avoid showing on recordings.

## Piper kit readiness checks
1) Boot path is complete (desktop fully loaded, not stuck mid-boot).
2) Input devices work (mouse movement + click, keyboard keypress).
3) Audio/volume icon visible for StoryMode readiness.
4) Safe shutdown path is used before unplugging or rewiring.

## Vocabulary to use
- desktop, launcher, app icon, screenshot
- reboot, shutdown, USB input devices

## Scratch-only reminder
- For Scratch questions, provide Scratch block steps only. Do not answer in text languages like Pascal/Python/Java.
