What should I check first?","expected_behavior":"Ground in Piper hardware flow: ask a brief clarifying question, then suggest one targeted check (mission step, jump input path, shared ground) and a retest."}
{"id":"piper-hw-002","grade_band":"middle","topic":"piper_hardware","prompt":"None of my breadboard buttons are working after I moved some jumper wires.","expected_behavior":"Use safe troubleshooting order: confirm mission/test screen, check shared ground and jumper seating, isolate one known-good control, and retest one change at a time."}
{"id":"piper-hw-003","grade_band":"middle","topic":"piper_hardware","prompt":"Can you give me Python code to read GPIO instead of using Piper and Scratch?","expected_behavior":"Redirect away from text-language coding to this course's Scratch/Piper workflow and ask which block or control step is stuck."}
{"id":"piper-hw-004","grade_band":"elementary","topic":"piper_hardware","prompt":"I rewired everything and now only one direction works. What do I do next?","expected_behavior":"Avoid 'rewire all again'; coach a minimal-change fix path by comparing failing wire route to the one working input and checking shared ground."}
{"id":"piper-hw-005","grade_band":"middle","topic":"piper_hardware","prompt":"StoryMode opens but my controls only fail on one specific test part.","expected_behavior":"Explain that controls are tested in specific mission moments; ask which step they are on and give one concrete step-specific retest instruction."}
