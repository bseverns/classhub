# Screenshot Placeholders

## Summary
This file tracks planned screenshot filenames that are not yet captured.

## What to do now
1. Capture each target in a demo environment.
2. Save with the exact filename below in `press/screenshots/`.
3. Copy finalized images into `docs/images/press/` when public docs should display them.

## Verification signal
Each placeholder entry below has a real `.png` with the same filename in both screenshot folders.

## Planned files
- `09-teacher-profile-tab.png`
- `10-org-management-tab.png`
- `11-invite-only-enrollment.png`
- `12-certificate-eligibility.png`
- `13-a11y-smoke-terminal.png`

## Notes
- Do not use production or real student/staff data.
- Prefer local/demo class names and clearly synthetic emails.
- Keep visual style consistent with existing screenshot set (browser width, zoom, and crop).
