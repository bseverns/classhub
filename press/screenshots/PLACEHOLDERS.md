# Screenshot Placeholders

## Summary
This file tracks planned screenshot filenames that are not yet captured with final UI images.

## What to do now
1. Capture each target in a demo environment.
2. Save with the exact filename below in `press/screenshots/`.
3. Copy finalized images into `docs/images/press/` when public docs should display them.

## Verification signal
Each placeholder entry below has a `.png` present in both screenshot folders:
- `press/screenshots/`
- `docs/images/press/`

During planning, these may be generated placeholder images. Replace them with real captures before external publication.

## Planned files
- `02-student-class-view.png` (refresh capture to show current landing structure)
- `05-lesson-with-helper.png` (refresh capture to show helper collapsed/open behavior)
- `06-submission-dropbox.png` (refresh capture for simplified status copy)
- `09-teacher-profile-tab.png`
- `10-org-management-tab.png`
- `11-invite-only-enrollment.png`
- `12-certificate-eligibility.png`
- `13-a11y-smoke-terminal.png`
- `14-student-compact-view.png`
- `15-lesson-helper-collapsed.png`
- `16-student-standard-view.png`
- `17-student-expanded-view.png`
- `18-teacher-landing-editor.png`

## Notes
- Do not use production or real student/staff data.
- Prefer local/demo class names and clearly synthetic emails.
- Keep visual style consistent with existing screenshot set (browser width, zoom, and crop).
