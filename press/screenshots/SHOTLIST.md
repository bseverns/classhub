# Screenshot Shot List

## Summary
Use this list to capture consistent, privacy-safe screenshots for public sharing.

## What to do now
1. Capture each target file below.
2. Use demo data only (no real student names/emails/class codes).
3. Blur or redact any sensitive identifiers before publishing.

## Verification signal
When complete, `press/screenshots/` contains all filenames in this list and each image can be mapped to one product workflow.
