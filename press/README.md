# Press Kit

## Summary
This folder provides reuse-ready, factual materials for evaluators, partners, and contributors sharing Class Hub publicly.

## What to do now
1. Start with `press/one_pager.md` for quick context.
2. Copy short descriptions from `press/blurbs.md`.
3. Use `press/architecture.md` and `press/screenshots/SHOTLIST.md` for visuals.
4. If you need screenshots not yet captured, use `press/screenshots/PLACEHOLDERS.md`.

## Verification signal
If this press kit is complete for your use case, you can assemble a short external summary without opening internal engineering docs.

## Contents
- `press/one_pager.md`
- `press/blurbs.md`
- `press/architecture.md`
- `press/screenshots/SHOTLIST.md`
- `press/screenshots/PLACEHOLDERS.md`

## Usage rules
- Do not publish real student data.
- Use demo screenshots only.
- Keep claims factual and tied to current docs.
- Keep screenshot filenames stable once published so docs links stay valid.
- When UI structure changes, refresh existing captures before adding net-new shots.
